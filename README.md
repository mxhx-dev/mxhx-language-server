# MXHX Language Server

A language server for [MXHX](https://mxhx.dev), a markup language for Haxe.

## Minimum Requirements

- Haxe 4.0

## Installation

This library is not yet available on Haxelib, so you'll need to install it from Github.

```sh
haxelib git mxhx-language-server https://github.com/mxhx-dev/mxhx-language-server.git
```

## Project Configuration

After installing the library above, add it to your Haxe _.hxml_ file.

```hxml
--library mxhx-language-server
```

For Lime and OpenFL, add it to your _project.xml_ file.

```xml
<haxelib name="mxhx-language-server" />
```
